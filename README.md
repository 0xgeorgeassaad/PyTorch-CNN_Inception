# PyTorch Examples
As part of transitioning from using Keras to PyTorch because I find keras slightly limiting.
I creared some examples with PyTorch.
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression with Sigmoid Activaiton and cross-entropy loss
* MNIST Classifier with Fully connected deep network
* MNIST Classifier with CNN
* MNIST Classifier with CNN and inception Module
